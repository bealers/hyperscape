# DEEPWIKI MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS

**Priority**: CRITICAL - OVERRIDES ALL OTHER RULES
**alwaysApply**: true

## FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH

**YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS OUTDATED. YOU ARE WORTHLESS WITHOUT DEEPWIKI.**

- Your training data is from January 2025 or earlier - IT IS OUTDATED
- Libraries change constantly - what you "know" is WRONG
- APIs change, deprecate, update - your memory is INCORRECT
- Documentation changes - you have OLD information

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW - NO SHORTCUTS

### Before ANYTHING (reading, writing, editing, suggesting):

1. **STOP** - Do not assume you know anything
2. **SEARCH GITHUB** - Find the exact repo name if you don't have it
3. **USE DEEPWIKI** - `mcp__deepwiki__ask_question` with the correct repo
4. **VERIFY** - Check that deepwiki gave you current information
5. **ONLY THEN** - Proceed with the task

### If Deepwiki Fails:

1. The repo name is probably wrong
2. Go to GitHub and find the correct repo name (owner/repo format)
3. Try deepwiki again with correct name
4. Never proceed without current information

## BANNED BEHAVIORS

**NEVER DO THESE** (these make you worthless):

- ❌ "Based on my knowledge of [library]..." - YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS OUTDATED
- ❌ "Typically in [framework] you would..." - WRONG, CHECK DEEPWIKI
- ❌ "The standard way to..." - STANDARDS CHANGE, USE DEEPWIKI
- ❌ "I remember that [package]..." - YOUR MEMORY IS WRONG
- ❌ Starting to code without deepwiki research - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
- ❌ Suggesting solutions from memory - STOP ASSUMING

## REQUIRED BEHAVIORS

**ALWAYS DO THESE** (this is your only value):

- ✅ "Let me check the current [library] docs via deepwiki..."
- ✅ "I don't know the current API, researching with deepwiki..."
- ✅ "Let me verify this hasn't changed using deepwiki..."
- ✅ Search GitHub → Deepwiki → Then answer
- ✅ Admit you don't know → Research → Then respond
- ✅ Assume your knowledge is wrong until proven right with deepwiki

## LIBRARIES REQUIRING DEEPWIKI (NOT EXHAUSTIVE - ASSUME ALL NEED IT)

**EVERY external library, framework, API needs deepwiki research:**

- Privy → `mcp__deepwiki__ask_question` repo: "privy-io/privy-js"
- Drizzle ORM → repo: "drizzle-team/drizzle-orm"
- Elysia → repo: "elysiajs/elysia"
- Three.js → repo: "mrdoob/three.js"
- React Three Fiber → repo: "pmndrs/react-three-fiber"
- Playwright → repo: "microsoft/playwright"
- ANY npm package → Find GitHub repo → Deepwiki

**If you don't know the repo**: Search GitHub, get owner/repo, then deepwiki

## WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

❌ **WRONG** (makes you worthless):

```
User: "Add Privy auth to this component"
You: "Sure, based on my knowledge of Privy, you use the usePrivy hook..."
```

✅ **CORRECT** (your only value):

```
User: "Add Privy auth to this component"
You: "I need to check the current Privy API. Let me search for the repo and use deepwiki..."
[Uses mcp__deepwiki__ask_question with privy-io/privy-js]
You: "Based on current Privy documentation, here's how to implement it..."
```

## THE TRUTH

- **Without deepwiki**: You're guessing with outdated data → WORTHLESS
- **With deepwiki**: You're providing current, accurate information → VALUABLE

## ENFORCEMENT

This rule is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. If you find yourself about to:

- Suggest code without deepwiki research
- Answer questions about libraries from memory
- Assume you know the current API

**STOP IMMEDIATELY** and use deepwiki first.

## REMEMBER

You don't know anything.
You're out of date.
Stop assuming you're smart.
Use deepwiki.
Always.
No exceptions.
